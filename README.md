# LotusLink

LotusLink is a decentralized application (dApp) that empowers users to create a Link Page on the Arweave Blockchain. By leveraging the permanence and ownership capabilities of the blockchain, users can own their link page forever with a one-time payment.

## Features

- **Link Page Generator**: Create a personalized link page with custom links, and mint it onto the Arweave Blockchain.
- **Arconnect Integration**: Authorization and Authentication are handled securely using Arconnect, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Arweave Blockchain**: Your link page is yours forever. Once minted, it resides on the Arweave Blockchain, providing true ownership without recurring fees.
- **Svelte Framework**: Built using Svelte, LotusLink utilizes hash routing to enable a multi-page application experience on the Arweave Blockchain.
- **Profile Image Storage**: Profile images are stored using a user's unique ArDrive account. If a user doesn't have an ArDrive account, one will be created upon minting their first link page.
- **One-Time Payment**: Unlike traditional services that require monthly subscriptions, LotusLink requires only a minimum of 1.6 AR to mint a link page, providing lifetime ownership.

## Why LotusLink?

The traditional approach to hosting link pages often involves recurring payments and lack of true ownership. LotusLink disrupts this model by providing a platform where users pay once and own their link page forever. This not only ensures cost-effectiveness but also aligns with the decentralized ethos of true ownership and control.
